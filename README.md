## 🌟 Vision
OpenGamifyEdu is more than a platform — it's a movement. Designed for educators, learners, dreamers, and developers, this is the ultimate learning ecosystem powered by gamification, storytelling, community, and creativity.

## 🎮 What It Does

- Integrates real-world task management with RPG-style character development.
- Supports VR for immersive classrooms, science labs, or history adventures.
- Enables plugin support across languages (Python now, more coming).
- Encourages open collaboration from a global community.

## 🛠️ Features
- 🌐 FastAPI backend with real-time WebSocket support
- 🧠 Code execution sandbox (Python; modular for others)
- 🎨 Static frontend mount point (VR, Three.js, or your own UI)
- 🔌 Plugin-ready design for custom expansions
- 🔒 Custom license: Non-commercial, educational use only — forever
